number references, please keep them.

Your patch is now pushed, keep sending good patches ;)

        Looks reasonable - but I don't think we need that in the header, we

have it in the git logs for all the commits so we can unwind it later.

But ...

        Oh - well, everything gratefully received :-) whatever interests you

most is best I think. Of course, some of our bigger, nastier problems

are in the are of user-interface;

        Sure; so - you could poke another easy-hack, or carry on cleaning this

up. There are really plenty of interesting tasks - it often helps to

have several on the queue :-)

        Of course, things that improve the UI are much appreciated by end

users, and there are a number of open tasks in this area that are not

easy hacks if you're interested (Christophe had a nice idea of making it

rather easier to add notes by clicking on the ruler IIRC that might be

fun) :-)

        Ah - so - this bug is to a dead & obsolete Sun/Oracle bug tracker that

rides no more: it'd be good (in fact) to come up with a nice regexp to

find them all across the code & remove them.

        Sure - poke Lior Kaplan he's the man for RTL queries. I strongly

suspect the comment is right though - I don't think those guys want

backwards ticks in boxes ;-)

        Anyhow - thanks for the great work; looking forward to your next steps.

        All the best,

Ah! Ok.  I didn't spot that either.  Good catch.

Yup.  That makes sense.  No objection with that.

       I'm just working through the MPL/LGPLv3+ re-licensing audit at

the moment (so we can include code from Apache OpenOffice :-) What would

really help reduce the work would be if we could have a blanket

        We're missing your German comment translating skills these days :-)

although the work is still ongoing with some progress still -

[PATCH] fdo35365 default font color for documents

Hi,

here's a patch to fix bug fdo35365. Please also apply the patch in the

3.5 and 3.6 branch.

The underlying bug fdo50861 is only partially fixed by this patch. At

least two solutions comes to my mind for a full fix:

1) Store the default colors in the document.

2) Hardcode the default colors.

What do you think? What's the right approach to fix fdo50861?

My current and all future contributions to LibreOffice, unless

stated otherwise, are licensed under LGPLv3+/MPL until further notice.

PS: Thanks to Bj?rn Michaelsen, who helped me to dive into the code on

the LinuxTag.

[PATCH] fdo35365 default font color for documents

Hi Benjamin,

Thank you very much for the patch!  Unfortunately, I am afraid this

breaks the way we are handling the hicontrast theme that is supposed to

target visually impaired people - we use dark background and white text

in the hicontrast case (which wouldn't be the case any more with this

patch).

Adding the UX advise people what they think - I have no experience with

accessibility, so cannot say what is right in this area.  If they agree

that we should let the hicontrast behavior as it is, I'd prefer:

         case DOCCOLOR :

-            aRet = Application::GetSettings().GetStyleSettings().GetWindowColor();

+            aRet = Application::GetSettings().GetStyleSettings().GetHighContrastMode()? 
COL_BLACK: COL_WHITE;

             break;

and similarly for FONTCOLOR - how does that sound to you?

BTW, this all color setting thing requires a cleanup - why should we

have the baroque StyleSettings class, and on top of that this

ColorConfig approach to colors?  Are you interested in cleaning up /

consolidating the approach to colors as a follow-up? ;-)

If you can send it as a separate mail, ideally with a subject like

"License statement", that would be most appreciated, so that we can

clearly link that from the page where we collect the statements.

Thank you a lot,

Does it make a difference for visually impaired people between black on

white and white on black?

Is it really a good idea to allow the desktop theme to influence the

appearance of the document? Imagine following:

I create a document where LibreOffice is configured with black font on

white background. I select a brown 1 for the text and save it. Then

someone with a hiconstrast theme opens the document and will see dark

brown text on a black background. The contrast was reduces instead of

increased.

Please read bug 50861 and the examples given in comment 2 [1].

Yes and no. On the one hand it is appealing to me, but on the other hand

other free software projects already consume enough of my spare time.

Fixing a .doc header regression

Hi Luke,

Luke Deller p??e v ?t 01. 11. 2012 v 00:58 +1100:

> I am new to the LibreOffice code, and am trying to fix a regression I 

> encountered with headers in a .doc file, reported as fdo56513

Oh wow - first patch, and already in quite an involved area of

binary .doc interoperability :-) - great work!

I am CCing Miklos who is the expert in the area of first page, he has

just recently rewrote parts there.  Unfortunately he was away the past

few days, terribly sorry for the late feedback.

> Anyone know about this, or want to review the patch I attached to that item?

Generally it is best if you send the patch[es] directly to the mailing

list, with [PATCH] in the subject, that way you'll get the fastest

attention.  The alternative is to use gerrit, the LibreOffice review

system:

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit

Also - can you please send a mail to the mailing list approving that

your patches are licensed under LGPL and MPL, like "All of my past and

Yeah, I think you're right, so I pushed your change. Thanks for that,

means we can finally close that easy hack.

The existing code is very tricky in that method and it's not immediately

obvious that the string at this point appears to be guaranteed to be >=

two previous characters, so it didn't hurt to add a check to ensure

that. So I added a check there and tweaked the commit message to include

the bug id, (fdo42893) because that way our automatic tooling puts a

message into the bugzilla entry for the bug.

I think this is your first submission, so what we need now is a

statement that your code is under our preferred license combo.

So add yourself to

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

and follow the how-to, e.g. send a message like...

   All of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be

   licensed under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license.

to this list and when it appears in the archive add the link to it to

the wiki.

I don?t consider myself as a LO dev. I?d prefer not be on this list.

I can?t say:  ?All of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be

PATCH - SDRemote LO

Hi Junior,

Unfortunately your patch includes a lot of unnecessary reformatting

(space indentation replaced with tab-stops),

specifically in SlideShowActivity.java it's impossible to see what has

changed since the whole file has had all space-indentation replaced with

tab-indentation (i.e. git thinks the whole file has been removed and

recreated).

(There are also a few cases of lines with trailing space which the git

commit-hooks would usually complain about.)

No idea which editor/IDE you use, but if you could change back to space

indentation that would be hugely simplify reviewing the patch -- it

should probably be enough to configure it to use spaces for indentation

(four spaces per tab) and then reformat the file (I'm guessing you might

be using Eclipse?) which would remove most of the reformatting in the

patch.

Cheers,

Andrzej

PATCH - SDRemote LO

Hi Junior,

Thanks for the updated patch, there were still some minor niggles though

which I had to fix (see bottom of email).

Currently your patch only changes the sound settings at the start of a

presentation, I'm not sure if we'd want to change back to the original

volume settings once the presentation is finished though?

The minor issues:

- android:defaultValue="true" was removed for two CheckBoxPreference

settings -- I assume this was unintentional (possibly an overly keen IDE

removing things automatically)?

- Some trailing spaces and mixes of tabs/spaces left over -- git

complains about both of these when applying patches:

Since you aren't doing a full build the git commit hooks aren't being

installed, meaning you aren't warned when there are issues with

spacing/tabs/formatting -- you can force installation of the hooks by

running "./g -z" in the LibreOffice tree. (However anyone with the

commit hooks in place, i.e. most LO devs, will have warnings shown which

prevent use of the commit until the issues are fixed -- which is what I

had to do to test the patch.)

(The cleaned up patch is attached.)

Cheers,

        Andrzej

[Libreoffice]  [PATCH] 39468 "translate German comments,

 removing redundant ones" part two

Hi,

Attached is a patch for bug 39468 "translate German comments, removing redundant 
ones". So after applying the patch there should be no German comments in the core-director
ies basegfx - cairo (incl.) anymore.

All my changes in this patch and all my future contributions are under the MPL/LGPLv3+ 
dual-license (think I've said so already, but anyway).

I know it's a lot to review but I can't help it - it's just a lot of German comments 
=)

Hope it works and is all fine -

OK, then. To implement that "hopefully over time, bit by bit we can

incrementally re-write it as a clean MPL/LGPLv3+ thingit", we need to

clearly establish that all future contributions to these files are

LGPLv2.1+ / MPL1.1. So I'm changing the headers *again* to say (with parts

[Libreoffice] [PUSHED] Docuview code cleanup

Hi Michael,

you were faster than me: I've been playing with that code lately, 

rewriting all of the ImplDrawSymbol routine and was planning to do the

last verifications/cleanups this evening and send it today or tomorrow

with also a picture including all of the old symbols and the "new" 

ones, in both enabled and disabled states and also with "non gray" 

rectangle background to verify that they fit the desired area.

The new patch will also clean many of those local variables and avoid 

calling the bitmap/polygon functions for drawing a circle.

Sorry for this delay, but the codebase is huge, my laptop slow and I'm

a little bit rusted with c/c++. But I took the chance to also do some 

basic dbg sessions, I hope I'll be faster next time.

I was planning to have a look to easyhacks for future contributions, 

but if you think it's worthy I can focus on docuview some more :)

Hope to send you the new patch (with picture) ASAP.

Thanks

Matteo

[Libreoffice] [PUSHED] Docuview code cleanup

Hi Michael,

    please also note that for SYMBOL_CHECKMARK I kept both normal and 

mirrored versions of the symbol, as in the original routine, although 

the comment

// 106953 never mirror checkmarks

seems to mean that this is not desired. But I don't know if the 

comment is obsolete, misleading (could it mean that the bug was that 

checkmarks was not mirrored, as they should?) or correct (and in the 

latter case implementation is wrong). As a beginner I really don't 

know where to search for such a bug report and, honestly, I'm a bit 

puzzled by bug identifiers (fdo, i or whatelse). I did some internet

research about checkmarks in RTL, without results. Unless the original

bug report is found, this issue should/could eventually be clarified 

with some RTL people.

Thanks again

Matteo

Except this: is this really needed? As far as I see, it's not used.

Also:

- Please do a 'git commit -a', and 'git format-patch -1', and send us

  the result, not the output of 'git diff', as described here:

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/DevelopmentPreparing_patches

- Lastly, can you confirm that your contribution is provided under the

  project license?

Sending a mail to the list, saying:

"All of my past and future contributions to the LibreOffice project are

should be enough. (You only need this once.)

I notice you're not yet listed on

[PATCH] Replacing '__LOADONCALLAPI' with 'SAL_CALL' definition

 It is not, and that's because the patch contains the latest commit in the 

LibreOffice git repository. It looks like you didn't actually commit your 

changes (in general, you should do your changes, 'make', 'git commit -a' 

and 'git format-patch -1', and you either forgot the commit part or it didn't 

work out for some reason).

Hi Artur,

thank you for the patch - since I don't find you on record with a

was no license included with your patch, would you mail a statement

like the below to this list please

Patch for postgresql driver

On Wed, Apr 17, 2013 at 09:39:59PM +0100, Wols Lists wrote:

> I've now got the patch done.

> Could someone with a postgresql implementation please test and push?

Thank you for your patch. From looking at it, it looks good to go to

me, but technically I wasn't able to apply it and we have some

administrivia to go through. Sorry for the administrivia, but we'll

need it only once.

I don't see a link to a license statement in

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

Could you please confirm that this patch (and, to make things easier,

all your future contributions to LibreOffice) are licensed by you

under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license? Thank you in advance.

When I try to apply it with "patch -p1", it says:

patching file connectivity/source/drivers/postgresql/pq_connection.cxx

patch: **** malformed patch at line 71: @@ -527,6 +515,11 @@ static void properties2arrays
( const Sequence< PropertyValue > & args,

When I try to apply it with "git am" it says:

Patch format detection failed.

"git apply" says:

fatal: corrupt patch at line 71

It looks to me like you created the patch with "git format-patch" and

then modified the resulting file (or email template), and somehow the

patch got corrupted in the process.

In general, the best is to either:

1) Use gerrit

2) Generate the patch with "git format-patch" and then attach the

   *whole* file to your mail (not "just the patch" as you did).

Both of these methods allow to use git "natively" to apply the patch,

and (assuming your git is setup properly) to automatically get your

suggested commit message and the information of authorship recorded

into git. For example, now I don't know whether the git authorship

email should be wolslists at youngmanorg.uk (like the wiki Developers

page says), antlists at youngman.org.uk (the address that sent this

mail) or the more personal address you used to correspond with me by

email in the past. Please advise. I'm also not sure whether you'd like

the authorship name to be "Anthony W. Youngman" or "Anthony Youngman".

Could you please regenerate the patch so that I can apply and test?

Thank you in advance.

Since you have to regenerate the patch anyway, a rather minor nitpick:

I'd prefer C++-style cast rather then C-style cast:

 static_cast<int> (SAL_N_ELEMENTS( keyword_list ))

rather than

 (int) SAL_N_ELEMENTS( keyword_list )

An even better solution would be to make the "j" variable of type

size_t instead of int (that is, the same type as "SAL_N_ELEMENTS(

keyword_list )".

It seems we had two entries for you in the developer's list. I merged

the two. The second (which I had not seen) contains the link to your

license statement indeed.

This change makes sense. Thank you for your contribution. However,

before I can use it, could you please confirm that you allow us to use

it under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license? I don't find your name on the

list of people that have already agreed to that

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

Also, please send your patches as attachments, to avoid your mail user

agent (email program) to change spacing, do word wrapping, etc, which

makes the patch harder to read, and makes the "patch" program fail to

use it automatically.

[Libreoffice] [PATCH] [Janitor] Clean-up of Writer's

        sw/source/ui/app

Folks,

Here's another cleanup patch.  I made some executive decisions on what sort

of comments to ask; if they only made reference to a bug number, or a single

fundamentally content-free word, they likely went away.  I kept ones that at

least made an effort to explain what the heck they were fixing, even if it

was in German.  I translated three strings where it was obvious what they

were saying.

This, like all of my future contributions barring further notice, is

licensed under the LGPLv3+.  It also makes no functional changes.

[Libreoffice] [PUSHED] Docuview code cleanup

Hi Michael,

     please find attached:

* a revised patch, with a new ImplDrawSymbol;

* a picture with the drawings of all symbols, produced by both the old

   and by the new routines. All symbols were drawn with different sides

   of their target rectangle, and for each rectangle size 4 full

   sequences of symbols are drawn:

   - 1st one: target rectangle in red, original symbol

   - 2nd one: target rectangle in green, new symbol

   - 3rd one: original symbol with normal background

   - 4th one: new symbol with normal background

   Please note that the white contour can exceed the symbol rectangle

   "by design", since it's shifted 1 pixel right and 1 pixel down.

   This picture is provided for a simple comparison and not for

   validating the code, which deserves a review and possibly a test on

   the field.

Please find further comments interleaved.

The attached patch is contributed under LGPL3+/MPL1.1 license.

Yeah, using polygons could reduce that code, but I just begun 

contributing and I don't feel comfortable with such a big change, at 

least for now. Besides, I had a quick look at (rendering of) polygons 

and it looks a little too complicated for such small symbols and, if you 

take a look at the circles generated by the original ImplDrawSymbols 

(which made use of polygons), you'll see that the results were not so 

precise. This requires further investigation, anyhow, since also "line" 

routines are quite complex and are called many times for each symbol.

No problem, I see that there's a lot of activity in the repository :)

I'm planning to do some more cleanups in Docuview, I'll post them little 

by little. Is this kind of activities appreciated or would bug-solving 

be better? I'm asking this because this task was chosen by chance, more 

for training than for other reason.

Another question on preferred behaviour for future contributions: should 

I have posted this new patch as a new mail, with an explicit [PATCH] 

header in its subject?

hello Masataka,

yes, the Java accessibility bridge was effectively not installed;

thanks a lot for finding this problem and for the fix.

could you please confirm that you contribute this patch under

MPL/LGPLv3+ license?

the best way is to send a blanket mail to this list with the license for

pushed to master, plus some follow up cleanup to remove the old

AFAIK the Java accessibility bridge is only required on Windows,

so i've put it into ifdef WNT as well; in case that is wrong please

complain  :)

thanks again for the patch,

[PATCH] Translated german comments in sw/source/core/layout/

Hi everybody

As Nicolas Christener and I promised to Cedric at FOSDEM, we set sail to

translate the german comments in the sw/source/core/layout/ directory.

We're still not quite done, but here's what we have so far.

This, and any future contributions to LibreOffice are available

under the MPL / LGPLv3+ unless stated otherwise.

As far as I know, Nicolas has already sent his license statement, Stefan

will follow soon.

Since we're not very familiar with the code, it may well be that there

are conceptual mistakes in our translation, so read with care ;)

hi David,

thanks for bringing these regressions to this list; in my experience

usually QA people aren't very fond of looking at API issues.

unfortunately it's probably too late for 3.5.1 now, but 3.5.2 is just

some weeks away.

we have figured out a way that should work both in Python 2 and 3 (see

the comments in the bug).

oh, and it is great that you have patches for the bugs, and it would be

a good idea to mention that in the mail :)

thanks for finding these bugs and fixing them.

could you please confirm that you contribute the patches under

MPL/LGPLv3+ license?

the best way is to send a blanket mail to this list with the license for

all your past and future contributions to LO, add yourself to this wiki

page and add a link to that mail in the wiki page:

hi Jonathan,

i've pushed a lot of this to master now, i.e. this commit and its

some of the commits are cleaner re-implementations of what's in your

patch; hopefully the nss and soltools work for you.

the remainder is this stuff which i thought was too hacky to commit

as-is or should be unnecessary:

Android UI app selection menu

Attached is the android project  I created for integration in to the 

version control repository. I asked in the android-Dev irc channel and 

was told that the rest of the project would need to be hooked into the 

android project i'm attaching via NDK hooks and something else.

Also I have a question as i would like to improve on the menu I already 

have. Where are the icons for the respective programs found in the 

source code?

[PATCH][REVIEW] gbuild conversion: module cpputools

Hi David,

thank you for your comments. Here is another try.

As you haven't merged feature/gbuild_components branch to master

I let "gb_Executable_add_api" in place:

As you suggested the next modules to convert are:

idlc, l10ntools, rdbmaker, soltools, unodevtools

hi Daniel,

don't know much about this linguistic stuff, but your change looks

plausible, or at least the existing code looks wrong in case of

overlaps, so i've pushed your patch to master now.

could you please confirm that you contribute this patch under

MPL/LGPLv3+ license?

the best way is to send a blanket mail to this list with the license for

Eventually I managed to get the fog to lift while looking at this ( 

sorry for the delay, it is all new to me :-) ), your patch looks good ( 

in particular the nice splitting of handling of sql and basic 

highlighting ). Sorry if you have previously stated the licensing of 

your patch but I didn't see your name at 

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

So, if you could it would really help if you could confirm the license 

of your patch by sending a mail to the development list ( and ideally 

updating the wiki page mentioned previously ) with something like "All 

of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed under 

the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license"

Once we have the licensing clarified I would be delighted to commit this 

patch

thanks again

Hi there,

        Just a quick ping :-) long time no see in LibreOffice; but we're

getting around to doing our re-licensing, is there any chance you can

send a mail we can link into here:

        to the dev list, something like:

[PUSHED] - avoid a memset

Hi,

thanks for applying the patch and for the encouragement.

For the what's next, well I'm new with LO code source, so first I'll 

propose some small clean-up or optimizations. I'll surely also go 

through the "Easy Task" and bugzilla to see what I could have a look at.

Do not expect to much for now, it is just a spare time hobby, but open 

source is my way of thinking, so if I can help, even just a little... :-)

Here is for the license statement you required:

Looks like we are having a mis-communication here.

What we need from you is another email sent to this list, with the body 

of the message containing your license statement which can be just as 

follows:

All of my past and future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed

under the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license.

You keep including the license statement in the commit message of your 

patch, which is NOT what we need.  We need it in the body of an email.

I hope this clarifies our requirement. Sorry about the confusion, and 

thanks for the patch. :-)

Hi,

/Sorry for the last mails. Here is the mail, hopefully correct./

I submitted a patch for the bug 51309 - Names of DatabaseRanges should 

not be case sensitive :

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51309

You will the diff file attached and on the bug's page.

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=51309&attachment=69115

Changes :

- ScDBData::less::operator() is modified to compare upper strings

- All the calls to NamedDBs::findByName() are now NamedDBs::findByUpperName().

- In case of a call to findByUpperName by an argument, the function ScGlobal::pCharClass->
uppercase(aName) was used to ensure upper case.

- The definitions of FindByName() are deleted.

patch

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hash: SHA1

Hi Christine,

My journey home wasn't good.. as the trains didn't ride when I got back

in the Netherlands. So I had 2 hours of extra travel-time. But I'm home.

I don't have really time today to import your patch but I will do it

tomorrow.

But I saw that we haven't have a license statement for your patches.

Can you send a blanket license-statement (MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license) to

the developers-list of Libreoffice (I have cc'ed them). Something like:

All of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed

under the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license

I think the REST API for bugzilla is on bugs.freedesktop.org as far as

I know. But maybe Kendy can tell us for sure.

Rob Snelders

Patch for postgresql driver

Hi Lionel,

Okay, I'll sort out that patch and re-apply it for you. You should have

a licence email on record - sent to the list 2012-05-18 "Wol's grant of

licence".

I hope it was PGP signed ... :-)

Cheers,

Wol

If it's really necessary (I didn't contribute anything, just raised awareness, kinda 
like filing a bug report). Other open source projects make statements like "by contributin
g, you agree to license your code blah blah blah" to avoid people having to make 
public declarations.

So, yes, all my past and future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed under 
the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license.

I have signed this message with my PGP key, if that helps at all.

Fwd: license statement

Hi,

Whenever I submit a patch to gerrit using 'git push origin

<localbranchname>:refs/for/master', my patch is 'successfully' submitted

but 'no' mail is circulated on this list regarding submission of my

patches.

I have already sent a mail pertaining to 'license statement' (but have not

got any confirmation mail yet !). I wish to know whether there is something

more that I need to do or have I missed some procedural step that is

creating this problem ?

Thanking you in anticipation.

Save as formats explored

Thanks for the feedback.  The patches for all three are attached.

1.

I should reiterate that I'm just removing Write support ONLY for

"OpenOffice 1.0" formats.   You would still be able to open them and

save them as newer formats.  (This is very similar to what I did for

Word 95/6.0 which didn't seem to cause any issues).

I believe calling it OpenOffice 1.0 should have implied it's legacy.

2.  I went with Flat XML ODF Text Document.

3.  I went with Text - Choose Encoding.

One issue that I noticed is that if you make a Master Document, it

gives you the option to save as -> Text Encoded/Choose Encoding.

Should this be removed from there?

Thank you!

Bryan Quigley

GSOC 2012 , submitting a patch for easy hack

Hello there,

I think you've done ./g format-patch, which isn't necessary, because

you've made the changes in core repository only.

And I'm not sure whether we really need 'stdout' in the command.

What I usually use is:

    git format-patch HEAD~1

if you have done only one commit, a file name 0001-xxxx.patch will be

produced the working directory.

Also, you are recommended to do:

    git config --global user.name "your-firstname lastname"

    git config --global user.email "your-email at sample.com"

to properly have an author information in the commit message.

Next, for submitting a patch, it's better to start an email subject

with [PATCH] to catch an attention. :-)

And if you're fixing a concrete bug, it would be good to mention a bug

number in the commit message subject, in this case fdo47864.

Lastly, could you please send a blanket email confirming that this and

your future contributions are licensed under MPL / LGPLv3+ ?

Sorry for the long email, I hope you don't get bored yet :-)

And, welcome to LibreOffice! :-)

Best Regards,

German comments translation

Hi Philipp,

You are correct!

I was reading the file, following some bug, and found myself

translating the comments to understand what's going on and

so I thought I'd just send the resulting file across ;) . By the way,

no offense taken. I'll check the Easy Hacks.

And, Google Summer of Code ideas seem pretty interesting

too, so do you recommend me checking that (after an easy hack

or two), or is it just reserved for just the participants of GSoC?

(I am an Indian programmer, currently in Saudi Arabia, so that's the

reason behind the email and the blog.)

(Check the translated ones too, as the code was new

to me and I might have missed any nuances.)

Do comments need a licence statement? Anyway, you have

mine below.

[PATCH] Translated german comments in sw/source/core/layout/

Hello you two!

Thanks for the big amount of work. I know how tiresome it is to

translate this oververbose German to something that makes sense in

English. That and the technical jargon make translating it quite time

intensive. So kudos for that much work!

I think that it'd be much easier to review your patches and get them

integrated quicker if you post fewer of them and at an earlier stage.

Every little step counts and is appreciated :). I usually try to keep

under 50 K per patch - which makes for quite a few small files or one

large one with some smaller ones.

I saw that you also added TODO comments about the translation. That's

not very handy, as I cannot communicate with you about it :-).

It'd be nicer to either include the comment in the patch email or ask on IRC.

I noticed a lot of trailing whitespace errors. I had the same problem

in the beginning too, just find a plugin for your editor that removes

them for you or (if you use vim) you can add

autocmd BufWritePre * :%s/\s\+$//e

to your ~/.vimrc file (see http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Remove_unwanted_spaces).

I would greatly appreciate it if you could do that for any future

work. Then I don't have to fix them when reviewing. :-).

BTW: I'm reviewing the first five patches.

Cheers,

    Philipp

German comments translation

Hello Jesso,

Thank you very much and welcome to the LibreOffice mailing list!

While I appreciate your work, much of it looks as if it was the output

of an online translation tool... Correct me if I am wrong!

I spend some time tweaking your patch but gave up somewhere at line

120 or so... Especially because (in my eyes) trivial comments were

left out, e.g.:

=== snip ===

-    Input:  nIdx        - Nummer des angeforderten BLIP

+    Input:  nIdx        - Number of a requested BLIP

                           ( muss immer uebergeben werden )

=== end ===

(German translation of the sentence in parentheses: "has to be

provided every time"/"mandatory")

I've seen that your mail address in the patch is from Saudi Arabia.

Thus, I want to ask you how well your German skills are? I don't want

to offend you but if your German is not pretty well, there are a lot

of native people in the community who might be better for this job...

I think, I found your blog and it states that you are from India.

Phew, now I am confuesed ;-) But I also shows your general interest in

programming, so maybe you would consider reporting bugs of LibreOffice

or help on other topics as an alternative? Checkout

<http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_Topic>.

I am pretty sure that there will be something interesting for you!

All the best,

Philipp

Pushed! Thank you very much!

However, I had to remove some trailing whitespaces in your patch

before pushing it (git warns you when committing). Please take care of

those in your next contribution.

*Real Name:  Dave Richards

This first patch changes default US strings that are inconsistent and

confusing to end users.

1) Tooltip on the file picker indicates "Create New Directory", but the

next dialog indicates "Create new Folder"

2) The default shortcut reads "Default Directory" and should match what

appears in Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Paths where it's called "My

Documents".

Many inexperienced users do not use or understand the word "Directory".

3 Patches for FDO70998

I have added myself to the list of contributors. I have sent my licensing

to the list.

I was working on the EasyHack fdo70998 (

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70998). I am using a laptop

with low extra space on disk. I can't download the full source of

LibreOffice; therefore, I have not compiled my changes. I used opengrok a

while ago to find the files and diffed them locally. I am just altering

text.

Would somebody please review these patches, please?

There has been a patch applied to the bug since I posted these diffs to the

bug on 2014-06-14, but it should not affect these entries.

LibreOffice / openIndiana ...

thanks, direct pull from git behaves "correctly" to the same point.

gdb of core gives this error:

Core was generated by

`/home/sal/LibreOffice/libo/solver/unxsoli/bin/saxparser af_NA

/home/sal/LibreOf'.

Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

[New process 83473    ]

0  0xfec54eb8 in rtl_uString_release (pThis=0x29) at

/home/sal/LibreOffice/libo/sal/rtl/source/strtmpl.cxx:1043

1043        if (SAL_STRING_IS_STATIC (pThis))

so I guess there is some kind of corruption in the string "pThis" that

is being passed around.

I'll put this on hold till either OpenIndiana provide a different GCC,

or the git code changes in that area (which I'm assuming it wont since

it's stable everywhere else)

LibreOffice / openIndiana ...

that should have hopefully updated the wiki.

cheers for that (hopefully you've done the configure.in, changing the

grep's was my biggest bug bear :) )

I will clean up and see how far a fresh compile goes.

thanks.

Jon

[PATCH] 39468 Translate German comments

Hi Tom,

Welcome to LibreOffice development!

Well, there are two things that would be good:

1 It'd really help if you could use "git format-patch" to do patches

? that way we already get the name of the author, your email and a

commit comment.

2 It seems you've diffed the other way around (or you've translated

English into German)

So, would you re-do your patch with both points in mind, please?

> (do you need GPL stuff for comments? If so: I'm submitting this under the

It'd be great if you could instead dual-license this under LGPL v3+

and MPL v1+. If you plan on contributing more ? which you do ? you

know it, please just send a message saying that you license all

past/future contributions to LibreOffice under these two licenses.

Then add yourself to this wiki page:

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

Hope that helps,

Astron.

Thanks. I am verifying it but it looks fine.

One small detail: Please keep the commit comment lines under 80

columns. Not sure if there is any technical reason for this, but it's

our convention.

> there were an obscene amount of warnings (Mac OSX 10.8.2).

Were those in the bundled 3rd-party libraries (like icu, nss, etc) or

in LibreOffice's own code? Our own code is supposed to be warning-free

with most current compilers (except a few separately handled places,

where we use pragmas or options to make warnings non-fatal, or go

away). It is a good idea to configure your build with --enable-werror;

then the -Werror flag will be used when compiling LO's own code, and

any warnings will cause the build to stop.

> code is contributed under the LGPLv3+ / MPL

Ah OK. It might be easiest to give a blanket statement about past and

future contributions instead of remembering to say this with each

change,

Also, nowadays it is easier (we hope) to submit and review/accept

changes through gerrit instead of email. See

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit . (I hope that

is the relevant wiki page...)

Thanks for committing the patches (plus handling the regression introduced

by the proposed patch in fdo46926).

Looks like they've just been pulled into 3-5 so looks good.

Not sure how I missed mentioning that (I know I intended to), so

thanks for looking at the bugs even without knowing patches were

included.

Sorry for the delay on this part, as I've been offline a bit.  I'll

[PATCH] fdo42974 build process to auto-copy MS VCRT files

Hello all,

I eventually tackled my first fdo, here:  

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42974

Since it is checked by configure, I decided to update configure so it  

copies the files when found on the system.

And then, I thought: We provide moz/zipped files in  

http://dev-www.libreoffice.org/mozilla/, why not download them if they are  

not here and we need them ? So I did.

Well, even now, I am not sure configure should *download* anything, but  

well, we have no official pre-script, and since we check for it there, we  

cannot wait "make fetch" to do it. Or could we ?

Regards
