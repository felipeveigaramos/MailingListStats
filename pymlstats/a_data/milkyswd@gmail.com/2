I am still struggling with the 'invalid entry' message during LO build. The
followings are things I have done since you advised me last time:

1) corrected all 'critical errors' suggested
2) Tried to build and failed
3) Uploaded all files to Pootle, corrected all errors suggested by pootle
downloaded the translations and tried to build, not OK
4) Pulled the latest source code from git, switched to master and tried to
build, not OK

I did this on both Win and Ubuntu with same result. When I open the files
in Virtaal I cannot see any problem. What shall I do?

Regards,

Well I have gettext and in fact I have tried the command you gave me on all
offending files. I have also opened 2 of the files in poedit, and found "no
error". The first file which comes as having invalid entry (during build)
is [1]. I opened that file and compared it to a Hungarian translation using
Meld Diff Viewer.  The difference I spotted appeared at the bottom of the
files with many more comments in my file than the Hungarian one. Can that
be a cause?
