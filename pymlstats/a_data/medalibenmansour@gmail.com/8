I was building LO 4.1 version and i've found this option in
distro-configs\LibreOfficeWin32.conf:
--enable-win-mozab-driver

According to the wiki:
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Windows_Build_Dependencies#Install_Windows_Build_Requirements,
Mozilla build tooling is only used for LibreOffice versions older than
4.1.
I propose to remove this option from the file (LibreOfficeWin32.conf).

We also need to modify the autogen.lastrun for builds at this link:
http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/libreoffice-4-1/Win-x86_9-Voreppe/2013-11-11_21.19.15/libreoffice-4-1~2013-11-11_21.19.15_build_info.txt
Actually, we have in the same file: "--enable-win-mozab-driver" and
"--disable-win-mozab-driver"

By the way, is it normal that we can't see any build in this directory:
http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/libreoffice-4-1/Win-x86 at 42 ?

Thanks

that is true, but...

... what it actually means is that in contemporary releases it's no
longer possible to build the mozilla stuff from source (hence no need
for the tools); what --enable-win-mozab-driver does instead is to
download and unpack pre-built binaries and put them into the
installation set.

of course if we had somebody implement native Outlook / Outlook Express
address book driver we could remove that too :)

that is indeed funny to have both of these in there.

that's a good question - Thorsten, why isn't Win-x86 at 42 doing uploads?
