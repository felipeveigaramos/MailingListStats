I hope this idea is not modified and is a must need for libreoffice and so
i can work on it with full dedication so as to make it a task.

Hence i am noting down certain code pointers which i figure out are
important and changes can be one of the ways to bring about the intended
change:

1> We need to include a PresObjKind which mentions something for the custom
animation : *"PRESOBJ_CSTMANIM"
*
* *so you may view it here :
http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sd/inc/pres.hxx#28

2>As mentioned in point 1 , parallely i think we also need to put the case
of the PresObj for Custom Animation in GetPresObj and CreatePresObj  :
http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sd/source/core/sdpage.cxx#pSdrObj

If you think there is some change in the thought process/approach needed in
the same please do let me know and i would also like to know if we need to
make any kind of change in the CustomAnimationPane.cxx :
http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sd/source/ui/animations/CustomAnimationPane.cxx


Hope to receive a quick reply.

Regards,
Janit

Hi Janit,

good to see you're jumping right in! First off, I suggest you grab

 https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43039

(assign it to yourself), thus signalling to other hackers that you're
working on a fix. And then some outline of what you plan would be good
to know (for me at least) - i.e. just a sentence or two, can be in the
bug report, a simple use case.

I think there is quite a bit of overlap here with

 https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Gsoc/Ideas#Attach_animations_to_styles

, which is good - having this (partly) address is quite high on my
list. :)

Cheers,

-- Thorsten
