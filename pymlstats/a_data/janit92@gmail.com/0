I obviously know that my work is solely based on self-interest....it was
just a way to answer Tor,and hence I am sure you know the way we have been
working out this project since some time :) . This email is basically
intended to let you know the progress of my work for the patch(as per what
we had talked on the IRC that day) And it would be great if you could help
me out with the same so we can surely continue our enthusiastic work
towards the task .....

Hope this find you in good health.
Regards,
Janit

This seems to be a long awaited question i have been having in mind. As Tor
mentioned the name i dont think is a big deal for the header here,but what
i think is i need to understand the thing i asked earlier ,regarding the
matter at Line #148 . So it would be great if someone can help me out with
that.

Regards,
Janit
