I was just wishing to have a look at all the places where the presentation
objects are present.

I figured out that changing/adding a few presentation object at :
http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sd/inc/pres.hxx#28

can bring about the changes in presentation objects used everywhere.

It would be great if someone can let me know if adding a new object here
would lead to troubles in the other files where the header is used or other
objects are used.

Hope to receive a positive response from your end.

Regards,
Janit
