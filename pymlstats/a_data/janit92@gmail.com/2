Yeah i have had a look at this wiki page :
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit#Setting_Yourself_Up_For_Gerrit

loooong back(when i started hacking on LO codebase) and had played around
with it for a time being .But seriously and frankly speaking i am more
comfortable on this,but i am sure i will try to work on gerrit(as there is
always a scope to learn something new..and this has been a wonderful
leaning experience since then) now so as to ease the work.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Regards,
Janit
