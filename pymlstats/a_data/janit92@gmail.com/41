I see your patches keeps passing by. Sending your patch by email is not 
wrong, but we have another handy tool to review/comment/... patches -> 
Gerrit.

Please have a look at 
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit#Setting_Yourself_Up_For_Gerrit 
so you can send them that way. I think that's a lot easier for 
developers to review and leave comments.

Just my 0,02EUR (please be aware of the currency exchange ;-) )

Kind regards,
Joren
