	slides)', message_body='Hey!
I have been recently facing a problem when I open a .doc/.docx file with
more than 150 pages or a .ppt/.pptx file with more than 150 slides.The main
error is that just 3 pages/slides of all of them open up.

Being a developer I am sure I can fix it.It would be of great help if
someone can please provide me the codepointer so I can correct this problem
if it does exist seriously.

Hope to receive a positive and prompt reply from your end.

Regards,
Janit
