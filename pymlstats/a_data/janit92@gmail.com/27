	slides', message_body='Hey!
I am hereby attaching my patch which is a work in progress.

Thorsten : Check out *Line number 148* in sd/source/core/sdtool.cxx where i
have mentioned(i.e. in the form of comment) the query i have in mind ,and
the question i had asked you on IRC. I hope the surrounding code would make
things understandable.

Miklos : I have worked on proper identation as well as licence headers(But
still if you think there is a scope of improvement,do let me know , There
is always a scope of improvement.).

Its a great time working on such an interesting project,but i have some
doubts which i would like to clear :

1) I am able to code things regarding the STLPropertySet,SfxItemSet,etc.
but i am still not able to feel these concepts and specifically the indepth
meaning of the Preset! :o ( and yes that is why i have not been able to
explain certain functions in the comments properly, I am sure i will do
that once i am clear with it .)
So if someone can help me out understand this i am sure i would be able to
contribute in a much better and efficient manner as well.

2) I wanted to know the exact workflow of the other things that work from
the MasterSlide eg:Themes,Backgrounds,etc.I think if i can get the code
pointer for it, I would be easily able to know and figure out the loop-hole
and get nearer to solving this problem and hence bridge the Custom
Animations from The Master Slides.
(i am parallely working on the UI Part as well with the UI Team so it would
be great if things fall in place simultaneously :) )
And yes.. My work does not end here,i am continuing to work on the same and
will surely make the changes suggested  and add the new files i think i
would be building in some time. :)

Any inputs on code would surely be appreciated.

Hope this finds in good health.

Regards,
Janit

	slides', message_body='Hey Tor!

It is good to know that even you have been taking interest in this pretty
"important" task which i have been working on.

-- Regarding the compiling of the code , i bet i did compile it on my
machine as well,but as you said you have been getting some errors i would
be happy to look back into it. :D

--Regarding the use of ULONG , i actually did not  get into "some random
googling that found old OpenOffice.org code" .But rather i had used it in
some university project in my freshmen year and hence i thought of just
experimenting here too(i actually wanted to know the advantages and
disadvantages of using it here,and that is why i used it) . But yeah i dont
mind getting it off :)

-- I think picking up was a big task here as i had to dig into quite a lot
of code and hence figure out what to use and "where" ...because i am still
figuring out things regarding the UI (as i had mentioned in my last email)
, and i am sure i will make a better impact on the codebase there :)

-- Yes i think Thorsten would surely be able to feel the code in more
detail ( thanks again for giving me a "strict" guidance on the same) .

And yes regarding the easy hack thing...I dont think the name of the easy
hack does make a difference here.I have named it such , just because the
task revolves around this basic bug . Me and Thorsten have been discussing
the exact work we are planning to implement with ,also taking help from the
UI team ( on IRC as well as emails)  and i keep Thorsten informed about the
proceedings.

---And regarding the submission of the work in small pieces , i had talked
to Thorsten on IRC and i think as a mentor he wanted me to show him my
"work in progress" patch , and clear a few doubts in code i had and hence i
have mentioned that in my comments in the code as well as in my last email.
( and clearing up the misunderstanding , i am sure i havent been bad at
language errors except when i was a newbee in the beginning.But i am sure i
am  working on it , but my experience on the codebase and familiarity is
pretty important here while working on a bigger project and not on small
hacks ;-) :D .

Hope this finds you in good health.

Regards,
Janit
