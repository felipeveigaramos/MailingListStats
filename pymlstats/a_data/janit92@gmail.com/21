I just saw the patch,yes it definitely need clean up based on the white
spaces ,and yeah the numbers in the patch are added so that the UI fixes
right and hence the toolbar appears to be right.I am not sure about the
reason why the icons dont appear in your case,as it does appear when i run
the code on my machine.

And regarding the following:
debug: max width 388
      debug: max width 78
      debug: max width 55
      [...]
This is just an output for the debugging i had done for the UI purpose and
yeah it would be fine,i would get that part of the code out.

Regards,
Janit

I am hereby attaching my bug after making all the needed changes :
*I have removed all the unnecessary changes i had made to the code,i.e. i
did undo all the useless changes i had made to the code,thereby cleaning up
the code.
*removed the command that gave the output :
debug: max width 78
debug: max width 55
[...]
*now i think the display also seems to be perfect and the purpose of this
feature seems to be solved.

Any kind of help and suggestions for future hacking would be appreciated.

Regards,
Janit
