As i mentioned i have been following the patch attached on bugzilla posted
by Caolan :
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=75179&action=edit

-What i have done is used the pointer pStr which moves along the string
where the capitalisation is to be taken care of.
-I have traversed the string uptil we get a fullstop and also checked if
the second to last character is a fullstop (' . ').
-The problem i have been facing is that though it gets compiled,the change
doesnt show up when i try to run it i.e. after using
./install/program/soffice.When the Writer opens and i try to play around
with the test cases,it doesnt work according to the need of the bug/feature.

-i "think"i have done the code snippet right as i have also returned
sal_False where we have second last character as fullstop and sal_True in
the other cases.

This is what i have tried and i am sure the changes in the code i have made
are visible in the patch i just attached in the last email as well.

Hope to receive a positive response.

Regards,
Janit
