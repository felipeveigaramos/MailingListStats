Hi,
My POV: I would LIKE a "save (or better: close) and reopen in PP mode" 
for some  WRITER  documents. Those are data sheets and small catalogs, 
what mostly are opened to print some pages of the document as attachment 
for a delivery of goods or similar. So my suggestion would have been 
"let WRITER documents open documents in PP mode if they have been saved 
from PP mode", in some cases that saves some mouse clicks.

But that is a very low-value desire.

Currently Writer always will open in normal view mode (or Web view), 
even if the document has been saved from PP mode.

So we should eliminate that inconsistence by always opening documents in 
Normal View (or Page break preview mode, if selected), even if document 
has been saved from PP view. But I do not recommend to disable "save" as 
long as PP is active. That would be inconsistent compared to writer and 
might be worrying. Simply ignore "was in PP mode when has been saved".

Best regards

Rainer

Well, unfortunately we will probably have to adopt the Writer way (of
never opening in PP mode) in Calc too, due to the limitation I already
outlined in my other mails.  The preview window needs parts of the view
properties transferred from the main Calc window when it launches, and
if we launch the preview window first before we initialize the view
properties in the main Calc window first, we'd lose that opportunity.
This may have worked okay in the past when we didn't do any clever
pagination in the preview mode.  But now we do more sophisticated
pagination based on selected sheets, losing the proper initialization in
the main Calc window would be detrimental...

And hopefully you'll be okay with it.

Then I would propose disabling save in Writer too.  I have enough
reasons to believe that, in Calc at least, saving the document from the
preview mode would never work to everyone's satisfaction.  It would
always leave some weird corner cases even if we fix this particular bug
that Terrence reported.
