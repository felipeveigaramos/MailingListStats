Hello,

We branched 3.6 and have a new Master, I have to hurry up a little with 
my action to revise the Bugzilla version picker contents due to 
<https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Talk:BugReport_Details>. Please 
excuse me for being late with this.

First Steps

I just created a new Version 3.7.0alpha0+ Master, and since the fix for 
"Bug 49622 ? Increase column width for Version in query results "The 
version now will be shown correctly in queries.

I created Bug 50755, please add comments there quickly if you see that 
new Versions in Picker cause trouble

Further Proceeding

I will prepare a mass change of all Versions today, don?t worry, there 
will be no mass e-mails for the bugs.

When I will start with the modifications, Function of the "Bug 
submission Assistant" will be partially broken for a while. I will 
contact Thorsten Behrens to find a solution to modify Assistant ASAP.

I am planning to do most modifications today (2012-06-06) in the afternoon.

Possible Problems

There might (will!) be some Problems:

  1.   Bug Submission Assistant will be broken temporarily
  2.   External queries with Version relation will not work any longer
       and will have to be modified. Most saved queries should be
       adapted automatically, but I did not test that. Version entries
       in field "Custom search" will have to be adapted manually."
  3.   We will see what happens when someone reports a bug just when I
       am modifying a Version

Comments, hints, discussion please in
<libreoffice-qa at lists.freedesktop.org>

Best regards

Rainer

I really like it. I would like to use it in the future for git tags and
source tarballs.

The problem might be the tilda '~'. It is substituted to $HOME in linux
shell. I am not sure about other special meaning in some programing
languages or so.

Before we change it, we need to make sure that we do not break other
distributors. So, I have added the developer mailing list and several
distro packagers into CC.

IMPORTANT: Please, replay if you do not like the above scheme or if you
have even better solution.





Background:
===========

We currently use two version schemes in LibreOffice:

1. About dialog:
----------------

It has to be user friendly. Last release candidate is the final build,
so we must not mention "RC" in the version. The current scheme is:

	+ 3.X.Y alphaZ   - for alpha release
	+ 3.X.Y betaZ    - for beta releases
        + 3.X.Y.Z        - for release candidates; the last one is final

, where Y is the number of the bugfix release


2. git tags and source packages
-------------------------------

It needs to have correct alpha-numeric sorting. Otherwise, new versions
are not correctly handled by package managers, e.g. rpm, dpkg, zypper,
apt. The current scheme is:

       + 3.X-1.98.Z        - for 3.X.0 alpha releases, e.g. 3.5.98.1
       + 3.X-1.99.Z        - for 3.X.0 beta releases, e.g. 3.5.99.1
       + 3.X.Y.Z           - for 3.release candidates, e.g. 3.6.0.1

, where Y is the number of the bugfix release.


PROBLEM: The two version schemes are schizophrenic and could cause
confusion. In addition, bugzilla needs both alpha-numeric sorting and
user friendly meaning.

We either need to mention both versions in the about dialog and bugzilla
or come up with a better scheme that would be good for both purposes.

There are two more proposals:


3. Rainers:
-----------

	+ 3.X.Y.00Z   - for alpha releases
	+ 3.X.Y.0Z0   - for beta releases
	+ 3.X.Y.Z00   - for release candidates

The alpha-numeric sorting is correct. It is clearly associated with the
3.X release because there is no "X-1" number.

The problem is that it is not evident that .00Z is alpha, and .0Z0 is
beta. They are limited to 9 alpha and 9 beta builds. Also, I have newer
seen it anywhere else, so people are not familiar with it.


4. Ubuntu/Debian:
-----------------

	+ 3.X.Y~alphaZ   - for alpha releases
	+ 3.X.Y~betaZ    - for beta releases
	+ 3.X.Y.Z        - for release candidates

I really like this solution. It seems to have everything. We just need
to make sure that the tilda '~' is handled correctly and does not break
some tools.

It seems that RPM handles it correctly. I am going to check Build
service, and zypper.

Petr
