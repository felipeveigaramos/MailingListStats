Hi all,

I think I understand Joel's intention. I also have problems to find out 
whether a bug already is under observation of a developer (because he is 
in CC), that was more easy in the early time with very few developers. 
And I believe developers should become involved when all necessary info 
is in the report. So I also see some advantages (concerning queries) to 
add a developer to the "Assigned to" field.

But on the other hand, that might discourage volunteers (for EasyHacks 
and similar), and developers might feel pressed to start work on that 
particular bug. Most engraving disadvantage of changing the current 
proceeding is that it is a change of the current proceeding ;-)
It always takes long time with lots of discussion until  new proceeding 
will be accepted.

So I agree with Kohei, we should not modify this if we do not have very 
good reasons with really promising prospects for benefit. Of course, if 
someone has ideas here, we should discuss that (may be better on qa list?).

And - Thanks to Calc Team for reliably handling the bugzilla dashboard 
concerning Assignee, Target, ... . This eases our (at least my) work 
very much.

Best regards


Rainer

+1, let's take this off developer list and come up with a good solution
from QA team.

Apologies for moving too quickly on this and bringing it right to dev list.


Rainer, I'll start the conversation on QA list shortly, it might move to
the next call but I think there is room for improvement here.

Best Regards,
Joel
