Hi Joel,

thank you for your initiative. Can you please present your ideas with 
some more details on <libreoffice-qa at lists.freedesktop.org>?

Best regards

	This is prolly best on the libreoffice-qa list (I just CC'd it) - but
it's interesting on the hackers list too. Your cleanup sounds most
welcome [ to a non QA expert such as myself at least ] :-)

	Wonderful :-)

	It's good to have more people getting stuck into the bug cleanup - of
course, worth getting advice / input from Rainer & the -qa list, but it
sounds like you're on a good track to me :-)

	And thank-you ! it's really helpful to have more QA people scanning the
bug lists, confirming bugs & closing old duplicates.

	Having said that, there are thousands of open bugs - my report shows:
2.5k in the 'NEW' state, and 1.5k in the UNCONFIRMED state. 

	Fixing 6bugs per day on average, that's a good pipeline of a couple of
years work of fixing ;-) so the prioritisation work is really very
greatly appreciated to ensure we fix the right bugs.

	Thanks !

		Michael.
