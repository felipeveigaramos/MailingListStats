Hi all,

I really would like to learn what the reason of that instruction might 
be. I can't see any advantage of discussing problems in various lists 
instead of reporting them in Bugzilla, what's the first place where 99% 
of interested users will check whether his problem already is known?

I recommend to drop that instruction or to replace it by a more detailed 
one like
- for installation problems please
- for localization problems please
- for Help problems please wait, Help will be finished ...
and so on.

Best regards

Rainer
