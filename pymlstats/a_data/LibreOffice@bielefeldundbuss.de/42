Hi,

I doubt that such a list can be useful. My concern: lots of people start 
lots of comments "someone should ...".

I use Reminderfox what reminds me to check bugs where I have been 
involved and where other people's contribution was required (Needinfo 
...), and I think that proceeding is reliable in much more than 90%.

Only my personal point of view, of course!

Can you lease always leave a suggestion on what public list (like 
<libreoffice-qa at lists.freedesktop.org> discussion should be continued. 
Multi-lists-discussions are really painful.

I recommend to continue discussion on <libreoffice-qa at lists.freedesktop.org>

Bet regards

Rainer
