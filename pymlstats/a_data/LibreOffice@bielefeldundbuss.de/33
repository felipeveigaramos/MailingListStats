Hi all,

during the last QA call we decided to do a mass close for NEEDINFO bugs 
without reaction for a too long time (>> 1000). There simply is too much 
time wasted by several people asking again and again for details without 
an answer. A very polite comment will be added that that closing was not 
because of a explicit refusal to a request or because we decided that we 
can live with a particular bug, but because we currently have no time to 
ask more than 2 times for more information. Additionally it is planned 
to add a key word to the whiteboard, so that these bugs can be found 
easily if required or if QA / developers will have boredom and too much 
time some day in future tho that they need something where they can work 
on ;-)

Details will be published and discussed the next days here, who wants to 
know more details or  wants to influence should join the next QA call 
(2012-07-13).

Best regards


Rainer

	Hopefully it'll help get the open count down a lot & reduce
frustration.

	Good stuff :-)
