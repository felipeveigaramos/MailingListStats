currently we again have the problem that we get no current WIN Master 
builds on the Tinderbox Server.

I see some successful builds (?) on 
<http://tinderbox.libreoffice.org/MASTER/status.html>, especially 
Win-x86_6, but there is no build for download on 
<http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/Win-x86 at 6-fast/master/>

On <http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/A> I see:
- @16-minimal_build: only has textfiles
   latest build:  2012-07-11_08.24.19
- @20-With-Symbol:
   latest build:  2012-07-15_01.33.34
- @6-fast:  only has textfiles
   latest build:  before 2012-07-16_15.35.37
- @6: only has textfiles
   latest build: before 2012-07-19_13.12.38
   On <https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Tinderbox>
   I only see 1 Tinderbx @6?
- @7-MinGW/master: empty
   latest build: ?
- @15-Prague_Win32: empty
   latest build: ?
- _9-Voreppe /libreoffice-3-6: contributes 3.6 builds
   Filename 3.6.1.0 is difficult to classify
   What is the difference to @9?

It would be very useful for me to have a feed or similar with 
information concerning latest available WIN builds. Is there any 
possibility?


Best Regards

Rainer

 Nightlies have been broken since *Env*.sh removal, the nightlies code has not 
been updated for config_host.mk . I've fixed that, whoever has a tinderbox 
uploading nightlies, please update.

 There was one more thing broken. The recent changes to get dev-install 
working changed the package format built in the 'build' target to .zip, so 
there was no .msi package to upload. I've reverted that change and moved the 
FORCE2ARCHIVE part to dev-install, but this whole 'build' target looks broken 
to me. What's the point of building a .msi archive there? Especially now with 
dev-install that looks completely pointless and it should have its own 
target. Does somebody understand this perl install cruft?
