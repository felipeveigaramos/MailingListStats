is there any possibility to get a reliable info that a new build is 
available from a particular WIN Tinderbox? I always have some 
test-to-dos in the line, not every test can be done with every build, 
and especially when (like now) new complete builds come very seldom 
those unsuccessful checks of the download server are really annoying.

Is there a solution for my problem?

Best regards


Rainer
