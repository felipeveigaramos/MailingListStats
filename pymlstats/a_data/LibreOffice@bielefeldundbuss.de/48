Hi,

yes, of course. The question is whether e-mail writer has had activated 
a Locale where that's not required. Where not, CTL (Complex Text Layout) 
should be disabled. It offers an additional Dialog for CTL fonts and 
lot's of other frills users really only need for CTL, so I think it 
should be disabled for languages where it is not required.

Best regards


Rainer

It's associated with the default system language, with an additional
look into some rather extra random windows locale setting on windows.
(opengrok for GetWin16SystemLanguage to find where the defaults get set
and used)

My proposal is that on windows we additionally default enable the CTL
(or CJK) features if a windows keyboard layout for a language is
installed (even if not in active use) which we would categorize as CTL
(or CJK)

Filed an easy hack at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54493
with some details seeing as it seems that GetKeyboardLayoutList gives "a
set of locale identifiers corresponding to the current set of input
locales in the system" so it should be fairly straightforward to see if
any of them are CTL and enable CTL features in that case and it all
"just works" out of the box so Shahar's mom gets the features she needs
and my mom doesn't get scary hangul<->hanga transliteration menus etc.
