thank you for the reminder, I also regret that I often only find "Bug 
12345 added", and I have to go to the bug and have to check what kind of 
bug it is and why it might be MAB ...

Only for additional clarification for users who joined bug triagers team 
not too long ago, that means: please do not simply add a "Blocks 37361" 
into the annoying bug's report, but open
Tracker Bug 37361, add No of your bug to "Depends on" and cite your 
bug's summary line and add 1-2 lines explaining why it should be "MAB".

Petr explained why that accelerates the workflow.
