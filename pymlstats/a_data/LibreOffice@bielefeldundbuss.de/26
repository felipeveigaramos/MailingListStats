Hi Rob,

great, thank you very much!

I think so, too. As far as I know "Localisation" is british, 
"Localization" USA spelling (and there might be some more differences, 
I'm not a native English speaker). I will ask on Lists, and if there are 
no concerns I will change that with the next LibO version release in 
Buzilla  and in the Wiki.

Best Regards


Rainer

Yeah, localization is the only correct spelling in US English.
Localization is also a correct spelling in UK English, though
localisation is an acceptable alternative spelling for UK English.

In UK English, selection between -ise/-ize variants is a matter of
style. The OED has basically an angry rant about -ise/-ize, which is
mostly available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling 

My OED (UK English) dictionary has...

"localize (also localise) ... derivatives localization (also
localisation)"

i.e. its not marked as
"localise (US localize) ..."
like
"colour (US color)"
is.

Use localization, globalization, etc., throughout regardless of US/UK
English IMO.

p.s.

A panda walks into a caf?. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a
gun and proceeds to fire it at the other patrons.

'Why?' asks the confused, surviving waiter amidst the carnage, as the
panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated
wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.

'Well, I'm a panda,' he says, at the door. 'Look it up.'
The waiter turns to the relevant entry in the manual and, sure enough,
finds an explanation. 'Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal,
native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.'
