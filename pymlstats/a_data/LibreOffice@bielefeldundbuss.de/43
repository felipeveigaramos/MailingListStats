some time ago I complained the ODF file types limitation on Wordpress com at
 
<http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/please-allow-upload-of-more-odf-types?replies=3#post-962915>, 

unfortunately without any success until now.

Currently I am forced to do some ugly chin-ups to get my data stored there.

May be some of you also having blogs on tat platform want to do their 
own complaints or at least leave a comment?

Further discussion please on
  <libreoffice-qa at lists.freedesktop.org>
