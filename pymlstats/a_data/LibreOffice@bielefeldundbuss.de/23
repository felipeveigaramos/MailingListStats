I am happy to see that we have a solution for the general problem, I 
will change picker texts with 3.6.0.0.beta2

The remaining problem is what we will do with

3.7.0.0.alpha1+    daily
3.7.0.0.alpha2+    daily
3.7.0.0.beta1+     daily
3.7.0.0.beta2+     daily
3.7.1.0.alpha1+    daily
3.7.2.0.alpha1+    daily
3.7.3.0.alpha1+    daily
3.7.4.0.alpha1+    daily
3.7.5.0.alpha1+    daily
3.7.6.0.alpha1+    daily

what are possible versions for the daily builds available during life 
cycle of 3.7 branch.

Those are a horrible lot of versions filling the picker with nearby 0 
reports/version (a "x.x.5" does not produce many regressions, and only 
few users will test dailies).

I would like to have a common "Branch Daily" in Bugzilla Version picker 
for these Versions, for example *"3.7.0.0.alpha++"* (this way only 
visible in Bugzilla, not in "Help About").

With acceptable workload it would be possible to create all those 
versions from above (also to have the possibility to use a Atom Feed 
"ticker" as "early warning system" and to shift them all to such a 
"3.7.0.0.alpha++" 1/4 year after life cycle of the branch has been 
terminated. So only 1 Branch version would remain for the picker instead 
of 10 (or so).

a) @petr:
Is my assumption concerning the "Daily" numeration (without remark 
"Daily" in "Help/About") correct?

@all:
Your Ideas?

Discussion please on <libreoffice-qa at lists.freedesktop.org>!

Ah, I forgot this ;-)

> 3.7.0.0.alpha1+    daily
> 3.7.0.0.alpha2+    daily

These will be used in the about dialog.

> 3.7.2.0.alpha1+    daily

We do not allow dangerous changes for bugfix releases => the daily
builds should have the quality of release candidates. So, there will be:

3.7.1.0+          daily
3.7.2.0+          daily
3.7.3.0+          daily
3.7.4.0+          daily
3.7.5.0+          daily
3.7.6.0+          daily

We have one alpha, three betas, three release candidates for .0 release,
and two release candidates for bugfix releases.

Nice trick.

Another solution would be to omit these daily builds versions in
bugzilla at all. It is motivated by these ideas:

	+ 3.6.0.0.beta2+ version is incomplete anyway; there are more
          daily builds with this version; reporter should cut&paste
          the whole buildid from the about dialog anyway

	+ daily builds are used only by active QA testers; they
          are more experienced and could handle the missing "+"
          versions in bugzilla reasonably
