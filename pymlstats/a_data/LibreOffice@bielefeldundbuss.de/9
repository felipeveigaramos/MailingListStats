it seems the original mail still is pending for moderation, so I try 
again with a direct mail to the list.

As a consequence of our QA related discussions at Hackfest April 2012 in 
Hamburg
<http://rrbd.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/hackfest-hamburg-2012/>
I now want to start to collect ideas how we can make a big step 
improving our (Bugzilla) Bug tracking system. The goal is that after we 
will have finished work (end 2012?) we will have a system what will work 
without bigger changes at least for the next 5 years for our growing 
contributors community.

As a tool for that I created 
<https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/How_to_Improve_Bugzilla>, I hope 
that we so can get an overview
what our needs are and how we can reach the goals.

Your contribution to complete the contents on that page will be appreciated.

Especially for the listed Problems we will need some expert knowledge

I hope that end of July we will have finished research and a clear 
concept how we can reach most goals with acceptable costs.

Best regards


Rainer
