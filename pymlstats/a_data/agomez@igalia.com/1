With the constraints we saw to start using FB3 and its native C++ API
straight away, we chose to go for FB2.5 and the native plain C API.

I think this is a safer path and migrating to native C++ and FB3 once it
is stable shouldn't be hard in the future.

I started doing it for Linux as an external dependency. I also started
walking the path to add FB as a bundled library inside LibO, but this is
far from being completed.

In any case, any help on Windows is welcome :)

Javier is the one leading the development effort of the SDBC driver. I
think he was saying that he could now split tasks to be done regarding
this.

I've updated it with the latest information I had.

	Right - ultimately the SDBC API is a C++ wrapper API, and piling up a
number of these around each other is something we can avoid if we got
this way (I hope) - particularly if a chunk of the work is already
done :-)

	Right; I wonder if we can make it compile with 2.5 and 3.0, IIRC the
embedding behaviour of 3.0 is significantly better.

	Great; when you do plan to start work Andrzej ? there is no doubt
plenty of fun to be had, and that's before the HSQLDB migration piece
gets underway. [ oh, and the unit test creation ;-) ]

	ATB !
