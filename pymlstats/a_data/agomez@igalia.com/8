Actually, I've been reading in LibO's Help which is the purpose of the
options under "Options -> Load/Save -> MS Office" and they seem to be
really attached to OLE importing/exporting.

Therefore, maybe this is not the best place in which to implement this
option.

The best and most obvious option seems to be "Options -> [Text Document|
Spreadsheet|Presentation] Options -> Compatibility". However, proper UI
with check boxes seems to be only "Text Document". "Spreadsheet"
"Compatibility" subcategory is quite different and it doesn't really
seem to face the task of selecting compatibility options among document
formats. "Presentation" doesn't even have a "Compatibility" subcategory.

In any case, my best guess is that we should go with these
subcategories. As we are facing now just Writer I suppose we can just
add another checkable option and, once we start implement similar
compatibility for "Calc" and "Impress" we can also add the needed items
and subcategories.

What do you think?

I support this approach :-)

Just so that this does not lead to confusion - SmartArt being a real
group shape is a relatively recent fix:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=59373b753902f69cd44d183568b084429322e7ab

In the previous versions it has been broken into individual shapes which
is the worst of all options from my point of view - but having a group
shape that the user has to explicitly ungroup to do his/her
modifications + drop the smartart metadata with this ungroup operation
seems reasonably valid to me (if we have undo for that, that is).

If we want to warn the users, we can use the the InfoBar (search for
AppendInfoBar) so that it is relatively unobtrusive for them...

With this - undoable operation, and the user notified, I don't think we
really need a setting what to do - or do you see any problems with the
above?

All the best,
Kendy
