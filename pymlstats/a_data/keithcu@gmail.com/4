I did some research for KDE and DPI. By default all windows are 96 DPI and
there is no screen auto-detection.

However, it is possible to manually set the DPI for KDE 4.x. In the system
settings, you can click on Appearance - Fonts and there is an option to
"force fonts DPI" to 192 or whatever. Fortunately, that setting applies to
more than fonts. When 192 is set, the HiDPI mode kicks in for LibreOffice
and it looks great.

I've read about more work happening for HiDPI in QT5 / KDE 5 which should
be out in the first-half of this year, but fortunately things can be made
to look fine with current code.

I'll put some updated comments about this in the wiki page also. Between
all the DEs, and other OSes, the test matrix for LibreOffice is large.

Regards,

-Keith
