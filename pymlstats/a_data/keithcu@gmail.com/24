Thank you! I've pulled your diff and doing a rebuild now. I have found that
5 pixels is a good value on my machine but I'll try 6, and it needs to be
shifted down one more pixel. Also, there may be dirt because it increases
the waveheight after the check. I believe Linux will return 96 dpi, but I
will check all this and improve as necessary, code against the new OutDev
value, and submit an initial set of fixes to Gerrit. The toolbar work was
being handled by Andrzej so I'll work on the other aspects. I've focused on
Writer, because that is what I use the most, but many of the changes help
all the apps and I've done some work in Calc and Impress also. I've made
one fix in the Sidebar, but it needs a few hours by someone who knows the
code, or a few days by someone who doesn't.

It would be great to get this in somehow as things are much prettier
already. I do this work because it is fun and easy, but there isn't much
value in icons and controls too small to easily recognize or click on.

Regards,

-Keith
