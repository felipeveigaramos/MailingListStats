I have done some reading that the next version of Unity is going to
have HiDPI support.

Do you know if they will return 192 DPI when on these screens like
what Gnome 3.10 does? I could find some Unity alias and ask, but you
might know or be able to encourage them ;-) Unfortunately, I can't
easily install Unity to test because I'd have to replace a lot of my
other core packages.

To be honest, I havent tracked HiDPI at all as I already have to watch out for
too many lose ends. I asked on #ubuntu-desktop and this is what I got:

11:08 < Sweetshark> I got an email request about HiDPI asking: "Do you know if they will return 192 DPI when on these screens like what Gnome 3.10 does? I could find some Unity alias and ask, but you might know or be able to encourage 
                    them ;-)" -- anyone having a quick answer to that?
11:09 < darkxst> Sweetshark, if they are asking for HiDPI on Full HD panels, it wont happen, atleast not from the GNOME side


HTH,
