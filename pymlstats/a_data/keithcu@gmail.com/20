Norbert has done a patch to master that should turn off the Mac
auto-doubling mode, but it doesn't appear to be doing anything. This
is confusing, but once it does work, then people can begin to decide
whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of turning off
compatibility mode now. (If not, then what should be done to tip the
balance?)

Also, no one has of yet tried to see what happens on Windows and no
one has responded with the right hardware on the QA alias:
http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Libreoffice-qa-HiDPI-testing-for-LibreOffice-4-2-1-td4095055.html

If the patches can get into a pre-release, it can get out to more
people who can find or help fix problems.

The change should be quite safe in that it only kicks in when the OS
returns >=144 dpi. One can almost think of this as an experimental
mode because so few OSes return that currently. This means it won't
enable the behavior in a number of machines that need it, but it
should be enough to be worthwhile, and allow input from more people. I
could try to submit a patch to enable it for more DEs and versions of
Windows, but it is perhaps better to be conservative initially. Xfce
already allows you to set the DPI. Maybe the next version of Unity
will be smart enough to return 192 dpi sometimes like Gnome 3.10 does?
It would be nice to get some testing on Ubuntu.

I'm not sure what to do next, and so I email you.
