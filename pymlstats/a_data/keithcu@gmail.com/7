The reason why nobody responded is no one knows, and it will generally
get worse over time as the codebases diverge. It is sort of like the
Java: "write once, test everywhere" situation.

One of the unintended consequences of the fork is the various ways it
makes things more difficult for third-parties. Users will generally
pick one product, but extension developers have a more complicated set
of choices because they may want to support multiple brands. Here is
an article I recently wrote about the power of brands that may be
helpful: http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?p=3163

The good news is that in the free software world, code flows with less
friction. Any typical (non-enterprise) who really wants an extension
will likely be able to install a specific version of the product if it
is required. It is just a download.

Good luck!

The best you can likely do is to check the code 
or dev documentation to see if it is in both places and if it is marked 
deprecated or not.

I do not know how to check the IDL, but, if you figure that out, I 
expect that it would not be too difficult to check that for 
compatibility (but I have never looked at it).
