I had no idea to where to put this so I appreciate your help. I verified
your idea works for all of the places I worked on so far because it can get
to a Window. If there were static constructors that loaded and cached
shared bitmaps, I think it could be a problem, but the earliest I've found
yet is control instance construction.

Thanks!
