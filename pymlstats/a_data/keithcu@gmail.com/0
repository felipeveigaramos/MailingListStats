has tried. You are the first person with a Windows HiDPI machine around, so
I hope you can try out another pre-release of 4.2.1 and give feedback? I
checked and Cebit is March 10th so that gives time to have something better
to show.

As for the hang, I saw it on Linux when trying to widen the sidebar past its
maximum width when the window had already been set wider than it should by
another part of the code which didn't respect the max value. I increased the
maximum width allowed for the Sidebar which should make the problem usually
go away ;-) You might be seeing another problem of course, your testing
would be helpful.

well, I have loaded the version 4.2.1 ;)

But nevertheless - yes, I will test and give you all the feedback I can
give :)

I will update the version during the first march week - so before CeBIT.

Best regards
