Elaborating on the last two sentences:
I verified that when OutlinerParaObject is NULL, SdrChainedTextPrimitive is
not created (and thus text cannot be moved to the second text box).

I traced the problem back to SdrTextAttribute objects in
createTextPrimitive not having a property isToBeChained set to true.
Apparently, this happens because createSdrFooAttribute functions
(sdrattributecreator.cxx) ignores chaining property. I fixed the issue for
createSdrTextAttribute but it seems not to be that simple for the sibling
methods.
Working on that...

This may still be necessary to bypass the problem.
