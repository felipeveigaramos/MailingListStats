an update on last week's work:
1) I wrote part of the basic code for Background Color attributes in
editeng;
2) I moved part of the rendering code from vcl to editeng;
3) I made some experiments with transparency.

Points (2) and (3) are still incomplete in this stage.
I am still trying to debug some misbehavior in (2)  and i had no successful
experiment in with transparency so far.
Fixing these two issues and writing more layout attribute-related code are
my core goals of the current week.

Cheers,
Matteo

Hi Matteo,

sounds excellent - and don't be put off by the initial bumps, editeng
& vcl is rather old code, with lots of bugfix and feature
sedimentations.

Cheers,
