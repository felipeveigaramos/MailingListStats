 OutputDevice::IsTextFillColor() but doesn't use the right color (just prints
 white)', message_body='Hi,
I'm trying to move to draw text background colors directly from editeng
(feature/gsoc14-draw-text-background-color).

I currently try to draw backgrounds for underlined text. For this
I modified EditCharAttribUnderline::SetFont so that the fill-color of the
font is set to a specific blue (by calling Font::SetFillColor).
As the attached picture shows, however, the background of the underlined
"U" is printed white rather than blue.

The only fact I could collect by debugging is that when
OutputDevice::DrawTextArray is called to draw U or N (see attached
picture), the font's fill-color of the OutputDevice is actually white for
U, instead of blue.
The important point is that, for some reason, when drawing U the method
OutputDevice::IsTextFillColor() returns true, whereas it returns false for
N; this might be determinant for the actual drawing of the custom
background later in the code.
Thus, the call to SetFillColor in EditCharAttribUnderline::SetFont seems to
have effects, but the information on fill-color is lost at some point
(despite the call to SetFillColor modifies it successful).

Does this ring a bell to anyone?
