I see, but thinking again I'm wondering: wouldn't specifying a text box
with a certain transparency style be enough for that family of issues? Or
is there something else text background may be required for?

I made a search in the specification and I believe it is
draw:chain-next-name<http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#attribute-draw_chain-next-name>
you
are referring to. Is that correct?

So, implementing this feature would require to:
- allow Draw to parse properly the attribute above (where does parsing of
attributes and similar happens in the code architecture?);
- implement the expected overflowing behavior (this should be simple
enough, but still I am not sure where text boxes are handled in Draw's
code);
- allow text boxes to specify a next link from the UI (maybe optional for a
Summer Project?)

I see. Could you please exemplify I could I test this in Writer?

I'm starting to believe that the first three features (text background,
overflow in frames and hyphenation)
could be sufficient for a summer project; adding more may make it risky.

You definitely did, thank you.
Now my goal is to get a better grasp of how to approach these problems in
the code and also which other subtasks they can be split it.

Cheers,
