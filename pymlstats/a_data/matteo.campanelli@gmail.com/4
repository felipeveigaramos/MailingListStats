from last week there is some encouraging progress:
- I implemented a suitable primitive2d class in svx/ for text needing to be
chained;
- when a page overflow occurs, the status "need to be chained" is set and
text from one box is copied in another by creating the appropriate text
primitive (text is still not truncated though).

An immediate next action is to  make the possibility of dealing with chains
that have more than two text boxes.

Cheers,
Matteo
