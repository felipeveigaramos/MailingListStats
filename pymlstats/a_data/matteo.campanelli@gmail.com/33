i was trying to set a transparent background in text areas in Draw.

I replaced the call to mpGraphics->DrawRect in OutputDevice::ImplDrawText
with a call to DrawTransparent on the same area. However the result has
issues such as [see attached picture]:
- not giving the expected color (the arrow text in the picture should be
the same color as the text area's),
- leaving old rendering leftovers around when text is moved (or the related
arrow in this case).

I tried to debug how other transparent areas are drawn but that didn't give
much insight.
Does anyone any experience with this or any guess on what may be going
wrong?

Thanks,
Matteo

- changing the text color to non-black did not change the grey-ish
background for the arrow's text;
- using SetTextFillColor immediately before does not change anything;
- debugging inside DrawTransparent I've seen that there is a "return false"
that is triggered three frames deeper: DrawTransparent ->
OutputDevice::DrawTransparentNatively -> SalGraphics::DrawPolyPolygon ->
X11SalGraphics::drawPolyPolygon.
In the last function this if-statement is triggered and the polypolygon is
never drawn I suspect:
[in core/vcl/unx/generic/gdi/salgdi.cxx:1023 ]
"""
// cannot handle pencolor!=brushcolor yet
    if( (nPenColor_ != SALCOLOR_NONE)
    &&  (nPenColor_ != nBrushColor_) )
        return false;
"""

*Errata on my last commit message*: It is mpGraphics->DrawRect to be
commented, not DrawTextRect.
