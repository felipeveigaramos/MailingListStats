last week was admittedly very little coding and mostly
debugging/(un)understanding/struggling:
- Text Fill color now works from editeng, but currently only under
edit-mode;
- I started identifying parts of code to make the background color a
stand-alone attribute (currently its inner workings are coupled with the
Underline attribute).

Cheers,
Matteo
