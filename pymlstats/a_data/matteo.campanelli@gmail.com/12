Integrals
 size made dependent on body.', message_body='Hi everybody,
I am posting my first LO patch.
https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/8569/

This code adds a new node structure in StarMath to deal with dynamic
integrals. I introduce a command "intd" in addition to the standard "int",
"intd" is able to resize according to the size of its argument.
This is supposed to be a first step in the potential inclusion of other
dynamically-sized symbols for sums, products...

Cheers,
Matteo
