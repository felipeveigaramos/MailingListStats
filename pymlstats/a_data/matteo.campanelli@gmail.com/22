last week focused on exploring the problems related with finding the source
of the issue for the text background color not working in non-edit mode.
Currently the problem has been identified in the drawinglayer module (for a
more detailed discussion see
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2014-June/061806.html ).

The main task of this week is closing the subgoals in the thread cited
above, thus getting solid text background working also in non-edit mode.

Matteo
