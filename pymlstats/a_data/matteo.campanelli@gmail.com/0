 failed attempt', message_body='Today I tried to embed some code to link the content of one text box to
another in Draw. I took heavy inspiration from some existing code in
SdrTextObj::FitFrameToTextSize()
<http://docs.libreoffice.org/svx/html/svdotext_8cxx_source.html#l00205>.
However I get a SIGSEGV in some other part of the code shortly afterwards.

What I tried to do was the following:
- Having two text boxes in the document,
- I tried to copy (a part of) the content from SdrPage::GetObj(0) into
SdrPage::GetObj(1). This occurs in svx's drawinglayer and in particular
in impTextBreakupHandler.
- The text is copied into the outliner of the second text box to be
layouted again (simulating what FitFrameToTextSize above does. An important
difference with that code is that now two different boxes are used).

This is the link to the main commit:

Here is the seg. fault message:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

SFX_ITEM_ON  ) )


Thorsten, any opinions?

Cheers,
Matteo

The long string of nines looks like the result of reading freed memory
in a debug build.  valgrind may be able to tell you where the memory
was freed, if you have the patience to wait for it.

HTH,
Terry.
