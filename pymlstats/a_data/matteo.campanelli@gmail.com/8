I'm working on adding text background color to Draw text frames but I
suspect I'm having troubles finding my way through the basics of the whole
application's architecture.
Browsing through code in sd/,  I haven't found anything that seemed to deal
specifically with text properties.
I suppose most of the responsibility for text features is in some external
module (editeng, by any chance?), but I don't understand where it is that
Draw-specific code makes use of these features.

Could anyone point to any documentation/code I could look at or could
anyone help me get clarity on this point?

Cheers,
Matteo

In general, TextFrame is a Writer concept, what you want to improve here
is the shape text of drawinglayer shapes, I guess. ;-)

Yes, it's editeng that provides the shape text functionality in
Impress/Draw.

include/editeng/eeitem.hxx provides the identifiers for editeng
properties, EE_CHAR_GRABBAG and EE_CHAR_CASEMAP are quite recent
additions, they may serve as a good example on how to add a new editeng
character (i.e. when the property is not for the paragraph, but only for
a portion of it) property.

That's the document model. Once you are done with that, the next steps
are dealing with UNO API, layout, filters, tests, UI -- but one step at
a time. :-)
