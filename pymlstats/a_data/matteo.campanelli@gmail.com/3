Last week there was little coding and only some more insights on which
parts of the code should be affected:
- found how Writer deals with tags for chained text boxes;
- AutoFit code may be a good point of reference for overflow check;
- the solution may involve marking the part of the text where the break
should occur in editeng, letting drawinglayer separately render these two
portions of text in the right places;
- more knowledge on the role of FormatDoc and CreateLines.

Cheers,
Matteo
