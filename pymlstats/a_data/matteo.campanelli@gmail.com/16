last week's work saw progress quite close to the final goal:
I was able to deal with overflowing texts in boxes by actually sending
only the overflowing paragraph in the next links.
There seems to be some misbehavior at the moment though (e.g.
sometimes some paragraphs disappear not showing neither the source box
nor in the recipient one).

Cheers,
Matteo

That might actually be there alright, but just the redraw happening at
an unfortunate time. Let's sit down on irc if the problem persists.
