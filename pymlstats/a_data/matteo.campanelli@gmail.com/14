Kohei, thanks for the tip - the issue seemed to be somewhere else however.

Summarizing once again, the problem was that I did get a text background
color in edit-mode but not in non-edit mode.
The problem seems to lie in the drawinglayer module, which takes care of
static rendering of text (thanks, Thorsten :-) ). In fact, currently, this
module knows nothing about text-portion-specific text color.

Rendering of text in this module seems to work (_roughly_) in this way:
(1) information on font (text color, underlining, italic...) are passed
from an external module [this is still subject of exploration],
(2) these font features are encapsulated in object of classes
TextFooPortionPrimitive2D,
(3) finally, the class VclProcessor2D makes the actual rendering out of
these primitives (by calling the ordinary text drawing methods from
OutputDevice).

Getting back to text fill color, the issue must be fixed at all three
levels:
(1') the fill color information should be passed by other modules,
(2') TextFooPortionPrimitive2D (probably TextSimplePortionPrimitive2D)
should be able to carry information on text fill color
(3') VclProcessor2D should pass this information to OutputDevice
appropriately.

I'm currently working on (1') and (2') but today I made an experiment and
the problem at level (3) is basically been figured out.

Best,
Matteo
