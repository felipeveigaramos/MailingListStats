- changing the text color to non-black did not change the grey-ish
background for the arrow's text;
- using SetTextFillColor immediately before does not change anything;
- debugging inside DrawTransparent I've seen that there is a "return false"
that is triggered three frames deeper: DrawTransparent ->
OutputDevice::DrawTransparentNatively -> SalGraphics::DrawPolyPolygon ->
X11SalGraphics::drawPolyPolygon.
In the last function this if-statement is triggered and the polypolygon is
never drawn I suspect:
[in core/vcl/unx/generic/gdi/salgdi.cxx:1023 ]

// cannot handle pencolor!=brushcolor yet
    if( (nPenColor_ != SALCOLOR_NONE)
    &&  (nPenColor_ != nBrushColor_) )
        return false;

*Errata on my last commit message*: It is mpGraphics->DrawRect to be
commented, not DrawTextRect.

Let me get a build of your exact version, will get back to you on that.
