??? I'm working on bug 65456, I have started
with the hint in the description. The getMainSequence() function
returns a pointer,when that is null it's sure that the slide doesn't
have animation on, but if that is not null it doesn't mean the slide
has animation. 
???? Than I thought it would work, if I'd
iterate all over the objects of the page and after that I could use
the hasEffect() function to determinate whether the object has
animation on, or not. This solution was working, but it took to a
problem, when I added a new object and set an animation on it, it
wasn't working (see Patch 6).
