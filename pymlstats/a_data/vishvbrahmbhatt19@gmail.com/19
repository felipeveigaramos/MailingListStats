Please guide me, if I have made any mistakes.

Also there is new file created

attaching that file too.

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Vishv,

wow, impressive work - compiles & works mostly fine here!!

Two things - there's a lot of whitespace change in your patch, and
also some trailing whitespace on some lines (the git commit hooks
complain about it) - could you clean that up?

And then, loading and saving this new field does not yet work. I think
the relevant code lives here:

 xmloff/source/text/txtfld{ei}.cxx

The scripting/workben/bindings/impressmenubar.xml change, you can just
skip, that seems example code.

As an extra, it seems changing the slide name does not update the
field content, possibly some
Broadcast(SfxSimpleHint(SFX_HINT_DATACHANGED)) or somesuch missing at
a strategic place? Of course, happy to merge w/o, and/or help with
tracking that nit down. :)

You can just git add offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/SlideName.idl
it, will then be included in your subsequent commit.

Cheers,
