I am very much exited to hear that I have been selected as one of the
student to work on LibreOffice for GSOC-2013 summer!

I am greatly thankful to all the community members for their support and
faith in me.

I will be hacking on LibreOffice to improve the  "Slide Layouts" in the
LibreOffice Impress. Preciously to make Slide Layouts configurable and
user-extendible, with the valuable support of my mentor Thorsten Behrens.
Here is the Link of my
Proposal<https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/vishv/1>
which
describes the broad aspects of my idea.I will be devising an accurate plan
with finest of details and will do my work in accordance to guidelines and
assistance of my mentor and community.

I have gone through the guidelines of "LibreOffice Community" for GSOC. I
am eager to dive into the code early.I am not habituate in writing
Blogs,but I'll soon start blogging about my progress on the project and
update the mailing-list with my weekly-report.

As described in the proposal,my contact number is +91-9428808343 and I will
be working from Ahmedabad,India(UTC+0530) throughout the summer.Also,I am
"vis19" on IRC.

Hi Vishv,

a very warm welcome also from our side - truly happy to have you
hacking on Impress over the summer! :)

Right, getting into the habit of regular public updates early would be
good, and with a blog, you can build a readership at the same time. :)

So the next steps are, making yourself comfortable with a recent
master build, get sd with debug symbols, and start wrapping your head
around how this is currently implemented. Code to read / place to
stick a breakpoint into and single-stepping is:

 sd/source/core/sdpage.cxx:AsCalcAutoLayoutRectangles()

Happy hacking,

-- Thorsten
