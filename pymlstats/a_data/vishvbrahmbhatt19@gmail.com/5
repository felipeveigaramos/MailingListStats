Thanks for your reply.

Actually I did make right entry in the makefile('test/Package_unittest.mk')
and also added a test-profile at appropriate
location('test/user-template/user/config/soffice.cfg/simpress/layoutlist.xml').But
this commit<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?h=feature/gsoc-impresslayout&id=a837a7c573c5f35fbcf7b9375725282496b0f4c9>
had
only partially solved the problem(for the unit-test). Because as per my
discussion with Thorsten,it seems that there is some problem with how
"brandbasedir"(i.e vnd.sun.star.expand:$BRAND_BASE_DIR) is expanded for the
"*unit-test*".

Can you please suggest me appropriate pointer to the makefile,so I can
either change how "brandbasedir" is expanded for "unit tests" or may be I
could stick the xml files into a different directory.

Thanks and Regards,
Vishv

Seems this whole test/user-template/user/config/soffice.cfg thing has
bitrotted - I presume it can go entirely, can you try & do a fresh
build for double-checking?

Instead, the impress xml config would need to go to
solver/<platform>/unittest/install/share/... , just like in the
regular install.

HTH,
