	Sounds great.

	This is a great question. Prolly the best thing to get stuck into just
now is the effort to re-draw all of our dialogs to improve the
underlying technology used; you can read about it here:

	http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/WidgetLayout
	
	You'll initially need to install a Linux system, and get glade working
in order to re-draw the relevant dialogs: do you have that ? after that
getting a build is rather useful - can you poke at:

	http://www.libreoffice.org/developers-2/

	For instructions there ? again Linux is the easiest environment to get
setup and building.

	Looking forward to your contributions !

	All the best,

		Michael.
