[Libreoffice] [PATCH] [Janitor] Clean-up of Writer's

 sw/source/ui/app

Hi Phil,

Many thanks for your patch. I removed/adapted some hunks due to the

removal of some comments containing iXXXXX stuffs: those are OOo bug

number references, please keep them.

Your patch is now pushed, keep sending good patches ;)

        Looks reasonable - but I don't think we need that in the header, we

have it in the git logs for all the commits so we can unwind it later.

        Oh - well, everything gratefully received :-) whatever interests you

        Sure; so - you could poke another easy-hack, or carry on cleaning this

up. There are really plenty of interesting tasks - it often helps to

have several on the queue :-)

        Of course, things that improve the UI are much appreciated by end

users, and there are a number of open tasks in this area that are not

easy hacks if you're interested (Christophe had a nice idea of making it

rather easier to add notes by clicking on the ruler IIRC that might be

fun) :-)

        Ah - so - this bug is to a dead & obsolete Sun/Oracle bug tracker that

rides no more: it'd be good (in fact) to come up with a nice regexp to

find them all across the code & remove them.

        Sure - poke Lior Kaplan he's the man for RTL queries. I strongly

suspect the comment is right though - I don't think those guys want

backwards ticks in boxes ;-)

        Anyhow - thanks for the great work; looking forward to your next steps.

        All the best,

       I'm just working through the MPL/LGPLv3+ re-licensing audit at

the moment (so we can include code from Apache OpenOffice :-) What would

really help reduce the work would be if we could have a blanket

statement from you for all past/future contributions we can link into:

        "All of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be

        sent to the libreoffice at lists.freedesktop.org would be wonderful (no

        We're missing your German comment translating skills these days :-)

although the work is still ongoing with some progress still -

Thank you very much for the patch!  Unfortunately, I am afraid this

breaks the way we are handling the hicontrast theme that is supposed to

target visually impaired people - we use dark background and white text

in the hicontrast case (which wouldn't be the case any more with this

patch).

Adding the UX advise people what they think - I have no experience with

accessibility, so cannot say what is right in this area.  If they agree

that we should let the hicontrast behavior as it is, I'd prefer:

         case DOCCOLOR :

-            aRet = Application::GetSettings().GetStyleSettings().GetWindowColor();

+            aRet = Application::GetSettings().GetStyleSettings().GetHighContrastMode()?
COL_BLACK: COL_WHITE;

             break;

and similarly for FONTCOLOR - how does that sound to you?

BTW, this all color setting thing requires a cleanup - why should we

have the baroque StyleSettings class, and on top of that this

ColorConfig approach to colors?  Are you interested in cleaning up /

consolidating the approach to colors as a follow-up? ;-)

> My current and all future contributions to LibreOffice, unless

> stated otherwise, are licensed under LGPLv3+/MPL until further notice.

If you can send it as a separate mail, ideally with a subject like

"License statement", that would be most appreciated, so that we can

clearly link that from the page where we collect the statements.

Does it make a difference for visually impaired people between black on

white and white on black?

Is it really a good idea to allow the desktop theme to influence the

appearance of the document? Imagine following:

I create a document where LibreOffice is configured with black font on

white background. I select a brown 1 for the text and save it. Then

someone with a hiconstrast theme opens the document and will see dark

brown text on a black background. The contrast was reduces instead of

increased.

Please read bug 50861 and the examples given in comment 2 [1].

Yes and no. On the one hand it is appealing to me, but on the other hand

other free software projects already consume enough of my spare time.

Oh wow - first patch, and already in quite an involved area of

Generally it is best if you send the patch[es] directly to the mailing

attention.  The alternative is to use gerrit, the LibreOffice review

system:

Yeah, I think you're right, so I pushed your change. Thanks for that,

means we can finally close that easy hack.

The existing code is very tricky in that method and it's not immediately

obvious that the string at this point appears to be guaranteed to be >=

two previous characters, so it didn't hurt to add a check to ensure

that. So I added a check there and tweaked the commit message to include

the bug id, (fdo42893) because that way our automatic tooling puts a

message into the bugzilla entry for the bug.

I think this is your first submission, so what we need now is a

statement that your code is under our preferred license combo.

So add yourself to

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

and follow the how-to, e.g. send a message like...

   All of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be

   licensed under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license.

to this list and when it appears in the archive add the link to it to

the wiki.

I don?t consider myself as a LO dev. I?d prefer not be on this list.

I can?t say:  ?All of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be

licensed under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license?, as my previous and future

patches on the French dictionaries are not under dual license, but only

under MPL 2 or LGPL.

But, yes, this patch is licensed under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license.

PATCH - SDRemote LO

Hi Junior,

Unfortunately your patch includes a lot of unnecessary reformatting

(space indentation replaced with tab-stops),

specifically in SlideShowActivity.java it's impossible to see what has

changed since the whole file has had all space-indentation replaced with

tab-indentation (i.e. git thinks the whole file has been removed and

recreated).

(There are also a few cases of lines with trailing space which the git

commit-hooks would usually complain about.)

No idea which editor/IDE you use, but if you could change back to space

indentation that would be hugely simplify reviewing the patch -- it

should probably be enough to configure it to use spaces for indentation

(four spaces per tab) and then reformat the file (I'm guessing you might

be using Eclipse?) which would remove most of the reformatting in the

patch.

Cheers,

Andrzej

PATCH - SDRemote LO

Hi Junior,

Thanks for the updated patch, there were still some minor niggles though

which I had to fix (see bottom of email).

Currently your patch only changes the sound settings at the start of a

presentation, I'm not sure if we'd want to change back to the original

volume settings once the presentation is finished though?

The minor issues:

- android:defaultValue="true" was removed for two CheckBoxPreference

settings -- I assume this was unintentional (possibly an overly keen IDE

removing things automatically)?

- Some trailing spaces and mixes of tabs/spaces left over -- git

complains about both of these when applying patches:

Since you aren't doing a full build the git commit hooks aren't being

installed, meaning you aren't warned when there are issues with

spacing/tabs/formatting -- you can force installation of the hooks by

running "./g -z" in the LibreOffice tree. (However anyone with the

commit hooks in place, i.e. most LO devs, will have warnings shown which

prevent use of the commit until the issues are fixed -- which is what I

had to do to test the patch.)

(The cleaned up patch is attached.)

Cheers,

        Andrzej

[Libreoffice] [PUSHED] Docuview code cleanup

Hi Michael,

    please also note that for SYMBOL_CHECKMARK I kept both normal and

mirrored versions of the symbol, as in the original routine, although

the comment

// 106953 never mirror checkmarks

seems to mean that this is not desired. But I don't know if the

comment is obsolete, misleading (could it mean that the bug was that

checkmarks was not mirrored, as they should?) or correct (and in the

latter case implementation is wrong). As a beginner I really don't

know where to search for such a bug report and, honestly, I'm a bit

puzzled by bug identifiers (fdo, i or whatelse). I did some internet

research about checkmarks in RTL, without results. Unless the original

bug report is found, this issue should/could eventually be clarified

with some RTL people.

Thanks again

Matteo

Except this: is this really needed? As far as I see, it's not used.

Also:

- Please do a 'git commit -a', and 'git format-patch -1', and send us

  the result, not the output of 'git diff', as described here:

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/DevelopmentPreparing_patches

- Lastly, can you confirm that your contribution is provided under the

  project license?

Sending a mail to the list, saying:

should be enough. (You only need this once.)

Thank you for your patch. From looking at it, it looks good to go to

me, but technically I wasn't able to apply it and we have some

administrivia to go through. Sorry for the administrivia, but we'll

need it only once.

I don't see a link to a license statement in

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

Could you please confirm that this patch (and, to make things easier,

all your future contributions to LibreOffice) are licensed by you

under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license? Thank you in advance.

When I try to apply it with "patch -p1", it says:

patching file connectivity/source/drivers/postgresql/pq_connection.cxx

patch: **** malformed patch at line 71: @@ -527,6 +515,11 @@ static void properties2arrays
( const Sequence< PropertyValue > & args,

When I try to apply it with "git am" it says:

Patch format detection failed.

"git apply" says:

fatal: corrupt patch at line 71

It looks to me like you created the patch with "git format-patch" and

then modified the resulting file (or email template), and somehow the

patch got corrupted in the process.

In general, the best is to either:

1) Use gerrit

2) Generate the patch with "git format-patch" and then attach the

   *whole* file to your mail (not "just the patch" as you did).

Both of these methods allow to use git "natively" to apply the patch,

and (assuming your git is setup properly) to automatically get your

suggested commit message and the information of authorship recorded

into git. For example, now I don't know whether the git authorship

email should be wolslists at youngmanorg.uk (like the wiki Developers

page says), antlists at youngman.org.uk (the address that sent this

mail) or the more personal address you used to correspond with me by

email in the past. Please advise. I'm also not sure whether you'd like

the authorship name to be "Anthony W. Youngman" or "Anthony Youngman".

Could you please regenerate the patch so that I can apply and test?

Thank you in advance.

Since you have to regenerate the patch anyway, a rather minor nitpick:

I'd prefer C++-style cast rather then C-style cast:

 static_cast<int> (SAL_N_ELEMENTS( keyword_list ))

rather than

 (int) SAL_N_ELEMENTS( keyword_list )

An even better solution would be to make the "j" variable of type

size_t instead of int (that is, the same type as "SAL_N_ELEMENTS(

keyword_list )".

It seems we had two entries for you in the developer's list. I merged

the two. The second (which I had not seen) contains the link to your

license statement indeed.

This change makes sense. Thank you for your contribution. However,

it under the MPLv2/LGPLv3+ dual license? I don't find your name on the

list of people that have already agreed to that

Also, please send your patches as attachments, to avoid your mail user

hello Masataka,

yes, the Java accessibility bridge was effectively not installed;

thanks a lot for finding this problem and for the fix.

AFAIK the Java accessibility bridge is only required on Windows,

so i've put it into ifdef WNT as well; in case that is wrong please

complain  :)

unfortunately it's probably too late for 3.5.1 now, but 3.5.2 is just

we have figured out a way that should work both in Python 2 and 3 (see

[PATCH][REVIEW] gbuild conversion: module cpputools

Hi David,

thank you for your comments. Here is another try.

As you haven't merged feature/gbuild_components branch to master

I let "gb_Executable_add_api" in place:

As you suggested the next modules to convert are:

idlc, l10ntools, rdbmaker, soltools, unodevtools

David

PS:

contribution notice.

All of my past and future contributions to the LibreOffice project are

under LGPLv3+/GPLv3+/MPL until further notice.

hi Daniel,

don't know much about this linguistic stuff, but your change looks

plausible, or at least the existing code looks wrong in case of

overlaps, so i've pushed your patch to master now.

could you please confirm that you contribute this patch under

MPL/LGPLv3+ license?

the best way is to send a blanket mail to this list with the license for

all your past and future contributions to LO, add yourself to this wiki

page and add a link to that mail in the wiki page:

Eventually I managed to get the fog to lift while looking at this (

sorry for the delay, it is all new to me :-) ), your patch looks good (

in particular the nice splitting of handling of sql and basic

highlighting ). Sorry if you have previously stated the licensing of

your patch but I didn't see your name at

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

So, if you could it would really help if you could confirm the license 

of your patch by sending a mail to the development list ( and ideally 

updating the wiki page mentioned previously ) with something like "All 

of my past & future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed under 

the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license"

Once we have the licensing clarified I would be delighted to commit this 

patch

thanks again

[PUSHED] - avoid a memset

Hi,

thanks for applying the patch and for the encouragement.

For the what's next, well I'm new with LO code source, so first I'll

propose some small clean-up or optimizations. I'll surely also go

through the "Easy Task" and bugzilla to see what I could have a look at.

Do not expect to much for now, it is just a spare time hobby, but open

source is my way of thinking, so if I can help, even just a little... :-)

Here is for the license statement you required:

Looks like we are having a mis-communication here.

What we need from you is another email sent to this list, with the body

of the message containing your license statement which can be just as

follows:

All of my past and future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed

under the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license.

You keep including the license statement in the commit message of your 

patch, which is NOT what we need.  We need it in the body of an email.

I hope this clarifies our requirement. Sorry about the confusion, and 

thanks for the patch. :-)

Best,

Kohei

If it's really necessary (I didn't contribute anything, just raised awareness, kinda
like filing a bug report). Other open source projects make statements like "by contributin
g, you agree to license your code blah blah blah" to avoid people having to make
public declarations.

So, yes, all my past and future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed under
the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license.

I have signed this message with my PGP key, if that helps at all.

Save as formats explored

Thanks for the feedback.  The patches for all three are attached.

1.

I should reiterate that I'm just removing Write support ONLY for

"OpenOffice 1.0" formats.   You would still be able to open them and

save them as newer formats.  (This is very similar to what I did for

Word 95/6.0 which didn't seem to cause any issues).

I believe calling it OpenOffice 1.0 should have implied it's legacy.

2.  I went with Flat XML ODF Text Document.

3.  I went with Text - Choose Encoding.

One issue that I noticed is that if you make a Master Document, it

gives you the option to save as -> Text Encoded/Choose Encoding.

Should this be removed from there?

Thank you!

Bryan Quigley

GSOC 2012 , submitting a patch for easy hack

I think you've done ./g format-patch, which isn't necessary, because

you've made the changes in core repository only.

And I'm not sure whether we really need 'stdout' in the command.

What I usually use is:

    git format-patch HEAD~1

if you have done only one commit, a file name 0001-xxxx.patch will be

produced the working directory.

Also, you are recommended to do:

    git config --global user.name "your-firstname lastname"

    git config --global user.email "your-email at sample.com"

to properly have an author information in the commit message.

Next, for submitting a patch, it's better to start an email subject

with [PATCH] to catch an attention. :-)

And if you're fixing a concrete bug, it would be good to mention a bug

number in the commit message subject, in this case fdo47864.

Lastly, could you please send a blanket email confirming that this and

your future contributions are licensed under MPL / LGPLv3+ ?

Sorry for the long email, I hope you don't get bored yet :-)

And, welcome to LibreOffice! :-)

German comments translation

Hi Philipp,

You are correct!

I was reading the file, following some bug, and found myself

translating the comments to understand what's going on and

so I thought I'd just send the resulting file across ;) . By the way,

no offense taken. I'll check the Easy Hacks.

And, Google Summer of Code ideas seem pretty interesting

too, so do you recommend me checking that (after an easy hack

or two), or is it just reserved for just the participants of GSoC?

(I am an Indian programmer, currently in Saudi Arabia, so that's the

reason behind the email and the blog.)

thanks, direct pull from git behaves "correctly" to the same point.

gdb of core gives this error:

I'll put this on hold till either OpenIndiana provide a different GCC,

it's stable everywhere else)

LibreOffice / openIndiana ...

that should have hopefully updated the wiki.

cheers for that (hopefully you've done the configure.in, changing the

grep's was my biggest bug bear :) )

I will clean up and see how far a fresh compile goes.

thanks.

[PATCH] 39468 Translate German comments

Hi Tom,

Welcome to LibreOffice development!

Well, there are two things that would be good:

1 It'd really help if you could use "git format-patch" to do patches

? that way we already get the name of the author, your email and a

commit comment.

2 It seems you've diffed the other way around (or you've translated

English into German)

So, would you re-do your patch with both points in mind, please?

> (do you need GPL stuff for comments? If so: I'm submitting this under the

It'd be great if you could instead dual-license this under LGPL v3+

and MPL v1+. If you plan on contributing more ? which you do ? you

know it, please just send a message saying that you license all

past/future contributions to LibreOffice under these two licenses.

Then add yourself to this wiki page:

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Developers

Hope that helps,

Astron.

Easyhack: Removing some unused functions

Welcome!

Thanks. I am verifying it but it looks fine.

One small detail: Please keep the commit comment lines under 80

columns. Not sure if there is any technical reason for this, but it's

our convention.

> there were an obscene amount of warnings (Mac OSX 10.8.2).

Were those in the bundled 3rd-party libraries (like icu, nss, etc) or

in LibreOffice's own code? Our own code is supposed to be warning-free

with most current compilers (except a few separately handled places,

where we use pragmas or options to make warnings non-fatal, or go

away). It is a good idea to configure your build with --enable-werror;

then the -Werror flag will be used when compiling LO's own code, and

any warnings will cause the build to stop.

> code is contributed under the LGPLv3+ / MPL

Ah OK. It might be easiest to give a blanket statement about past and

future contributions instead of remembering to say this with each

change,

Also, nowadays it is easier (we hope) to submit and review/accept

changes through gerrit instead of email. See

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit . (I hope that

is the relevant wiki page...)

Cheers,

[PATCH] German comment translation - vcl2

All of my past and future contributions to LibreOffice may be licensed

under the MPL/LGPLv3+ dual license.

BTW: I thought I messed up as I had not attached a correct BugID.

So I found the ID 39468 and attached it there.

LG, Chris
